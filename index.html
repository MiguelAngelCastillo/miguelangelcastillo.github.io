I am a man of SCIENCE, and math, logic, reasoning and other things not as important as science. I like colors, creativity, rockets, dogs, running. My favorite subjects are math and science. Those are my favorite subjects because, in my opinion, one can use math and science to understand the great big world.</p></div>
